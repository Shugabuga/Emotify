# Emotify
### *Emotify, The Ponymote Generator*

Emotify is a web application that converts your PNGs into the resources needed for moderators of subreddits to add their own emotes. This is based on [Stitches](http://draeton.github.io/stitches/), which does the same thing but for general-purpose CSS.
